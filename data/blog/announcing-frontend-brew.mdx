![Frontend Brew by Alexander Eckert](/static/img/frontend-brew/header.png)

## Background

Over the last few months I started to collect interesting [links](/links) that I have found around the web. Mainly [articles](/links/articles) about web development and programming. My goal is to create some sort of *library* that I can use to read up on some concept or idea.

## Announcing Frontend Brew

Frontend Brew is all about frontend web development with TypeScript and React. However, topics will also include productivity, linux, and functional programming. The newsletter is sent out bi-weekly and I am going to share with you some of my favourite articles from the past and present, as well as anything that has caught my attention recently. There will be content for everyone, from beginners to experts.

I won't send you useless rubbish though, I promise.
